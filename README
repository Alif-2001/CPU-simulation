#       CPU simulator in C
Implemented two CPU scheduling algorithms, FCFS and RR, to complete the execution of a group of mutli-threaded process.

--> Both algorithms work fine.
--> To increase the size of the Priority queue, change the PQSIZE in thread.c then compile.
--> For the verbose mode, the detailed information are automatically printed at the end of the output.

## Build the executable
    to build the simcpu executable, type the following in the comand line:
```
make
```

## Synopsis
    ./simcpu [OPTION] < [FILENAME]

### Options
    -d              print detailed information.
    -v              verbose mode (prints detailed information at the end of the output)
    -r 'quantum'    simulate round robin scheduling with the given quantum(an integer)

### Example
```
./simcpu -v -d -r 50 < input_file
```
or
```
./simcpu -vd < input_file
```
